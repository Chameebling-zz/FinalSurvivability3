# FinalSurvivability3
Submission for APCS Final Project 2018-19!

To run the program, use the main class Main.java in the package "main" to compile and run.

If you get several errors saying files are not found when running the program, open Main.java and change the first
constant "REL_PATH_TO_FILES" with the file path to get to the "maps", "fonts" and "images" files. You can see
where those files are placed based on the classes when you download this repository.

The file path in the constant should end with a "/", not a backslash. The "REL_PATH_TO_FILES" string gets prepended into
all file path strings. Make sure you have that forward slash!

If you are using jGRASP, you must open the project which is the Survivability3.gpj file, and then in the "REL_PATH_TO_FILES" constant in Main.java, make that "../"

If you are using Eclipse, make the constant "".
